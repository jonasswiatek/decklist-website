        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Your Data Rights</h2>
        <p>
          As a user based in the European Union, you have certain rights regarding your personal data, including the right to access, correct, or delete any information we hold about you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only the name you provide on your decklist is stored in our database, and you can delete that data yourself by deleting your decklist.
        </p>
        <p>
          We prioritize data minimization and do not retain data from past events. We don't collect statistics about your gameplay habits or preferences. This website was created to simplify the decklist submission process and avoid common issues with paper submissions such as illegible handwriting or missing information.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to delete your data, you can do so by removing your decklist. If you've forgotten the email you used to log in with, we may not be able to assist you as all data in our database is strongly encrypted. This encryption ensures that even in the unlikely event of a data breach, your information remains protected. We do not store emails, passwords, personal identifiers, or any sensitive personal information in our database.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decklists and information about events are automatically deleted within a week after the event ends to maintain data minimization principles.
